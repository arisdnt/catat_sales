```

## Why Port 3002?

Port 3000 is currently occupied by another process (PID 18864). Next.js automatically selected the next available port (3002).

## To Use Port 3000 (Optional)

If you want to use port 3000, you can:

1. Kill the process using port 3000:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   taskkill /PID 18864 /F
   
   # Or find and kill the process
   netstat -ano | findstr :3000
   ```

2. Restart the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Current Status

✅ **Development server is running successfully on port 3002**
✅ **All optimized endpoints are working**
